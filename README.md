This is my first automation project, designed to test address management on a test website. The test simulates the process of adding a new address and then removing it. The project is developed in Java, utilizing Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD), and Gherkin for writing clear, human-readable test scenarios.
